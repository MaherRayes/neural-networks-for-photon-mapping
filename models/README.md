We offer the best models we found in our experimentation. We have:

- Radius Prediction with: no photon contributions, tiny model and 25-nn photons.
- Kernel Prediction with: no photon contributions, tiny model and 25-nn photons.
- Direct Prediction with: full features, tiny model and 25-nn photons.
